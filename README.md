# Chatserver
Creating the chatserver with client server structure ,where multi-clients can be connected via server and can communicate with each other. Here, i used a concept of Java Socket programming, multi Threading and Swing Framework.
<br />
The functionality is as below
<br />
Each client is connected with server,so it means client is sending data to server and then server is broadcasting the data to every clients connected at a time.
<br />
Server has a record of each clients and additionally it can send the data to every client also.
<br />
Each client has their own GUI portal from where they can send and retrive data,and server has only terminal/console viewas it's name suggests.
